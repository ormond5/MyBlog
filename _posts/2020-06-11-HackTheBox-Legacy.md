This room is apart of the TryHackMeâ€™s OSCP path and it was aimed to be a similar difficulty to machines on the OSCP exam.

**Let's Begin!**

### Nmap

Deploy the box and run a nmap scan against the IP given to you!

```nmap -sC -sV -vv -p- <boxIP> -oN nmap-scan.txt```

The nmap scan will return back two open ports, port 22 and port 1337
